Make API templates in html file
Create function to render the page - don't forget export and async keywords
Grab template and the select in app.js - validate with console.log
In app.js make new function to render API - will need const and clone for each piece of api data you want to render.
Call function to see if we have effectively rendered data
addEventListener to track if change occurred - user clicked
grab target and set to variable to see which api call to render by using if statement.
Check if works and done. 



## Making a plan

1. **Make a drawing of your app. Simple "wireframes"**
1. **Once you have a drawing, name the HTML elements you'll need to realize your vision**
1. **For each HTML element ask: Why do I need this?**
1. **Once we know _why_ we need each element, think about how to implement the "Why" as a "How"**
1. **Find all the 'events' (user clicks, form submit, on load etc) in your app. Ask one by one, "What happens when" for each of these events. Does any state change?**
1. **Think about how to validate each of your features according to a Definition of Done**
1. **Consider what features _depend_ on what other features. Use this dependency logic to figure out what order to complete tasks.**

Additional considerations:

-   Ask: which of your HTML elements need to be hard coded, and which need to be dynamically generated?
-   Consider your data model.
    -   What kinds of objects (i.e., Dogs, Friends, Todos, etc) will you need?
    -   What are the key/value pairs?
    -   What arrays might you need?
    -   What needs to live in a persistence layer?
-   Is there some state we need to initialize?
-   Ask: should any of this work be abstracted into functions? (i.e., is the work complicated? can it be reused?)
